[Google Is Begging Apple to Make Life Better for Green Bubbles](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxngb9/google-is-begging-apple-to-make-life-better-for-green-bubbles)

I find this interesting article about the recent drama about Apple and Google message apps. This is not directly related to software engineering, but it addressed a common issue the industry has to deal with which are different companies developed different standards and created their own ecosystem. We as software developers have to deal with these standards. This article introduces a new interesting attempt from Google to try to solve this issue.
